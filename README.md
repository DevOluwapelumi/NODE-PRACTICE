# NODE-PRACTICE


To start a Node.js script or code, you'll need to follow these steps:

Install Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: Node.js Downloads. After installing Node.js, you will have access to both the Node.js runtime and the npm (Node Package Manager).

Create a Directory: Create a directory (folder) for your Node.js project if you haven't already. You can do this using your computer's file explorer or by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
mkdir my-node-project
Replace my-node-project with the name of your project.

Navigate to Your Project Directory: Change your current directory to the one you just created using the cd command. For example:
cd my-node-project

Create a JavaScript File: Create a JavaScript file with a .js extension in your project directory. You can use any text editor or code editor to create this file. Let's name it app.js for this example:
// app.js
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");

Run the Node.js Script: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory if you're not already there, and then execute the following command to run your Node.js script:
node app.js
If everything is set up correctly, you will see the output of your script in the terminal:
Hello, Node.js!
